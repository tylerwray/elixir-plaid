Full Documentation on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir_plaid).

### Core Principles

1. Fantastic documentation
2. Full plaid API coverage
3. Always return structs

### Example Usage

```elixir
# get auth data
Plaid.Auth.get("access-prod-123xxx", client_id: "123", secret: "abc")

# get item details
Plaid.Item.get("access-prod-123xxx", client_id: "123", secret: "abc", env: :production)

# refresh transactions
Plaid.Transactions.refresh("access-prod-123xxx", client_id: "123", secret: "abc", env: :development)

# get categories
Plaid.Categories.get(env: :production)
```

<!-- TODO: ADD hexdocs link to Plaid.config type -->

Each function takes a [`Plaid.config`](http://hexdocslinkhere.com) keyword list as it's trailing argument.
Authenticated requests require a `client_id` and `secert` at minimum for authentication with the plaid API.

You can also pass an `env` option as either `:production`, `:development`, or `:sandbox` (default).

> The choice to avoid using application configuration is due to the [anti-pattern documented by elixir](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/library-guidelines.html#avoid-application-configuration)
> of libraries using application configuration. Passing "configuration" to each function avoids the library touching any
> global state. As well as making function calls objectively more "functional".

> Likely you will need to pass keys dynamically anyway for development/production, overwriting the need for global application config.
> Therefor using patterns like those outlined in [this blog post](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/) and
> using a test mocking library like [Mox](https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html) help aid in making code more clear.

### Installation

Add `elixir_plaid` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_plaid, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Versioning

Each major version of `elixir_plaid` targets a specific version of the Plaid API:

| API version                                         | package version |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [`2020-09-14`][api-version-2020-09-14] (**latest**) | `0.x.x`         |
